My personal Blender Theme, Startup file and User Preferences.
- You can skip my User Preferences entirely, but there are some nice 
personal settings and configs for the free (and amazing) addon MACHIN3Tools.

Theme based on the official "Minimal Dark" theme.

## Install path:
%appdata%\Blender Foundation\Blender\3.x
